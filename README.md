# Resume Parser

## Abstract
The Resume Parser aims to automate the process of parsing resumes to extract relevant information such as skills, qualifications, and experiences. Leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, the system identifies skilled candidates based on their qualifications and matches them with job requirements set by personnel. This README provides an overview of the project's objectives, methods, and results.

## Acknowledgement
We would like to express our gratitude to our team members for their contributions to this project. Additionally, we extend our thanks to our project supervisor for their guidance throughout the project.

## Introduction
### Background
The recruitment process often faces challenges due to the large volume of resumes received for a single job position. Manual screening of resumes is time-consuming and inefficient. The Resume Parser project aims to address these challenges by automating the resume parsing process.

### Purpose and Objectives
The purpose of this project is to develop a Resume Parser system that can efficiently extract relevant information from resumes and match candidates with job requirements. The objectives include:
- Developing an automated system for parsing resumes.
- Implementing machine learning techniques for identifying skilled candidates.
- Creating a user-friendly interface for personnel to input job requirements and review parsed resumes.

## Project Overview
The Resume Parser project consists of two main components: the backend parsing module and the frontend user interface. The parsing module processes uploaded resumes, extracts relevant information, and matches candidates with job requirements. The frontend interface allows candidates to upload their resumes and personnel to review parsed resumes.

## Design Methodology
The design process involved:
- Requirement analysis to determine project specifications.
- Selection of appropriate tools and techniques for implementation.
- Collection of datasets containing Pakistani names, job titles, qualifications, etc., for custom entity recognition.
- Iterative development and testing of the parsing module and frontend interface.

## Software Description
The software components of the project include:
- Django framework for building the frontend interface.
- Custom pipes for entity identification in resumes.
- Python programming language for backend processing.
- Spacy library for natural language processing tasks.

## Results and Analysis
The project successfully parses resumes, extracts relevant information, and matches candidates with job requirements. Experimental results demonstrate the system's functionality, performance, and compliance. The analysis indicates high accuracy in identifying skilled candidates and extracting essential information from resumes.

## Discussion
The results of the project highlight its significance in streamlining the recruitment process and improving efficiency. Challenges faced during the project, such as integrating custom entity recognition and handling diverse resume formats, were successfully addressed through iterative development and testing.

## Conclusion
The Resume Parser project has achieved its objectives of automating the resume parsing process and facilitating efficient candidate screening. The system's successes include accurate information extraction, matching candidates with job requirements, and providing a user-friendly interface for personnel.

## Future Work
Future enhancements to the project may include:
- Implementation of advanced machine learning algorithms for candidate matching.
- Enhancement of the frontend interface with interactive features for personnel.
